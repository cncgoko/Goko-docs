== Installation

== Defining TinyG as target board

At first start, the application will prompt the target board selection dialog. For this tutorial, make sure TinyG v0.97 is selected and validate.
The application will starts with the configured components for TinyG.

NOTE: If you already launched Goko with a different target board, you can change it using menu:Windows[Preferences > General]

== Configuring serial connection

TinyG uses a Serial connection to communicate. We need to configure Goko so the connection can be established.

* Access the serial preferences page by clicking the image:gear.png[Settings] button in the serial toolbar, or by using the menu menu:Windows[ Preferences > Serial]

* Configure the following settings :
   ** Baudrate : *115,200*
   ** Data bits : *8*
   ** Parity : *None*
   ** Stop bits: *1*
   ** Flow control: *RTC/CTS*

* Hit Apply to validate your settings.

WARNING: the above settings are TinyG default settings. If you changed them in TinyG configuration before, make sure to adapt your settings.

== Activate serial console

* Make sure the serial console is activated, so you can monitor the incoming and outgoing data.

Serial console displays a green dot image:activated.png[Activated] in the top right corner of its stack border when it's activated.

== Connecting to TinyG

* Make sure the TinyG board is correctly plugged and powered.

* Select the TinyG Serial port in the combobox (name should be something like `usbserial-AE01DVWD` or `COM12`). If no serial port is listed, try to hit the image:reload.png[Reload Serial ports] button to refresh the list of serial ports.

* Hit the image:plug-connect.png[Connect] button to establish connection.
