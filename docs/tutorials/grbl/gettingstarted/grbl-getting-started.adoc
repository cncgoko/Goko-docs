This tutorial explains the basics of using Grbl with Goko

_Last modification: {docdate}_



== Installation

See link:../../general/installation.html[Installation tutorial]

== Define Grbl as target board

At first start, the application will prompt the target board selection dialog. For this tutorial, make sure Grbl v0.9 is selected and validate.
The application will starts with the configured components for Grbl.

NOTE: If you already launched Goko with a different target board, you can change it using menu:Windows[Preferences > General]

== Configure serial connection

Grbl uses a Serial connection to communicate. We need to configure Goko so the connection can be established.

* Access the serial preferences page by clicking the image:gear.png[Settings] button in the serial toolbar, or by using the menu menu:Windows[ Preferences > Serial]

* Configure the following settings :
   ** Baudrate : *115,200*
   ** Data bits : *8*
   ** Parity : *None*
   ** Stop bits: *1*
   ** Flow control: *Off*

* Hit Apply to validate your settings.

WARNING: the above settings are Grbl v0.9 default settings. Make sure they match your Grbl configuration. (Grbl v0.8 for instance use 9,600 as default baudrate)


== Activate serial console

* Make sure the serial console is activated, so you can monitor the incoming and outgoing data.

Serial console displays a green dot image:activated.png[Activated] in the top right corner of its stack border when it's activated.

== Connect to Grbl

* Make sure the Grbl board is correctly plugged and powered.

* Select the Grbl Serial port in the combobox (name should be something like `usbserial-AE01DVWD` or `COM12`). If no serial port is listed, try to hit the image:reload.png[Reload Serial ports] button to refresh the list of serial ports.

* Hit the image:plug-connect.png[Connect] button to establish connection.

The connection status at the bottom left corner of the application will now display a established connection.

== Grbl configuration

* Once connected, Goko will automatically retrieve Grbl configuration.

If everything goes well, you should be able to see the communication in the console, as shown below :

* For correct communication between Grbl and Goko, make sure the following parameters are configured as below: +

** ``$10=7 (status report mask:00000111)`` Set status report content including Machine Position, Work Position, Planner Buffer

== Conclusion

Goko and Grbl are now communicating correctly. You're ready to run your first milling job.

== Checklist for common connection problems

.Connection problems
