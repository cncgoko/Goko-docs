== Download

Make sure you download the version matching your OS and your JVM instance.

NOTE: Both 32-bit and 64-bit Java Virtual Machine can be installed and used on the same computer

To check your installed java version, take the following steps:

 . Open a Windows Command Prompt
 . Type `java -version`
 . A 32 bit version will output something like :

  java version "x.x.x_xxx"
  Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build x.x.x_xxx)
  Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build xx.xx, mixed mode, sharing)

 . A 64 bit version will output _(notice the 64-bit explicitely written)_

  java version "x.x.x_xxx" <br/>
  Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build x.x.x_xxx) <br/>
  Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build xx.xx, mixed mode)

== Java Runtime Environment

Goko requires Java 7 or higher to work. At the time of writing, the latest version is Java 8.

Installation instructions can be found here : http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html


== Extract

Simply extract the content of the downloaded archive to the target folder and run it :)

== Troubleshooting

=== Exit code=13

Some users have reported the following error when starting Goko :

.Exit code =13

This error usually happens when you try to run the 64bits version of Goko, but you're using a 32bits JVM on your computer.

Make sure you downloaded the version matching your OS and Java instance. See <<Download>>
