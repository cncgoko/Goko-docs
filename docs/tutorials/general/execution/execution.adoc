== Introduction

Now that you managed to connect to your CNC board, it's time to run some actual milling job.
This tutorial will guide you through the use of the workspace manager and the execution queue manipulation.

[WARNING]

== Load GCode files

* Import a GCode file in the workspace, using the image:folder-horizontal-open.png[Open] submenu or by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+G]

* In the opening selection dialog, select the GCode file to import and validate.

 * After validation the file is displayed in the Workspace part and the GCode is rendered in the 3D visualisation part.
