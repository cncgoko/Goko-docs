== Connecting to your board

=== Serial connection
Current version _({gokoVersion})_ supports Serial connection as it is quite commonly available at the time of writing.

The connection toolbar is located in the upper main toolbar and shows the following elements :

. The currently selected serial port,
. The refresh serial port list button,
. The connect button,
. The disconnect button,
. The serial setting button, which provides quick access to the serial connection settings.

Before connecting, make sure to configure the connection settings as required by your board parameters.

==== Serial preferences

Serial connections settings can be configured in the Serial preferences page.

You can access it by clicking the image:gear.png[Settings] button in the toolbar, or by using the menu menu:Windows[ Preferences > Serial]

==== Serial console

The serial console displays all data flowing through in and out the active serial connection. It can also be used to send direct command to the connected serial device.

.Sending data
Type the data in the upper input field and simply hit Send or press Enter key. The data will be completed with the selected end line character and then transmitted to the connected serial device.

WARNING: Manually sending data using the Serial Console during the execution of a gcode file is strongly discouraged as it may interfer with the execution process !

==== Serial console filters

Serial console output can be filtered to avoid some boring communication between Goko and your board.

Serial filters are defined using the following fields :

Description:: a user friendly description of the filter

Pattern:: the pattern used to detect the messages or the parts of a message to hide. This pattern is a standard Java regular expression _(see link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[Oracle documentation] for more details)_

Enabled:: whether or not this filter is active

Type:: defines if it's an input, output or bi directional filter. Input filters only apply to message received by Goko from the board. Output filters apply to messages from Goko to the board. Input & output filters apply to both cases.


NOTE: Serial filter only prevents the message from being displayed in the console. They are normally received and processed by any other process in Goko.
