== Working with GCode

=== Importing files

To import a file, use one of the following :

  - Use the Open image:folder-horizontal-open.png[Open], and select _GCode file_
  - Use the kbd:[Ctrl+G] shortcut

A file dialog will open asking you to chose a file. Any file can be opened as long as it's a text file and proposed extensions are only filters.

=== Workspace tree

==== GCodes
The workspace tree displays information about the loaded GCode programs and the modifiers applied to them.

When right clicking a GCode file, a contextual menu will appear allowing you to perform action on the given node.

==== Execution queue

The workspace tree also shows the GCodes in the execution queue and their current state.

TIP: When starting the execution, all the gcode programs in the queue will be executed in the order they appear in the Execution queue branche of the tree.

=== Modifying GCode

==== Modifiers

Modifiers are a convenient way to apply modifications to your GCode.
The modifiers you apply to an object are stored in a stack. By navigating up and down the stack, you can change the effect of the modifier.

.General considerations about modifiers :
 - unlimited number of modifiers can be added to a GCode program,
 - modifiers do not modify the original GCode file, and can be updated or deleted at any time,
 - the order of modifiers in the stack is important. Each modifier affects those that come after it.

NOTE: Some modifier have restrictions regarding the target GCode. For instance, Rotation modifier has a restricted set of option on GCode containing arcs, where arc are only defined in the XY, XZ or YZ planes.

See the list of available modifiers for detailed information.

==== Editor

The Editor part can be used to edit the source file of GCodes. This allow to tweak the program or fix errors.
