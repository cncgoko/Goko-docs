Understanding UI
################

Goko is a set of parts, also called view. The user interface, or **Workbench**, defines the presentation views.



Moving and docking views
------------------------

Any view in the workbench can be moved an docked at any location, providing high flexibility.

To change the location of a part :
 #. Drag the part by its title bar. Do not release the left mouse button yet,
 #. As you move around the applications, the new location of the part is displayed using a light green border,
 #. When the part is in the location you want, release the left mouse button.

 
 
Minimizing and maximizing views
-------------------------------

When you need to focus on a given part, you can optimize screen use by maximizing or minimizing parts.

**Maximize**
 A view can used as much of the display available using the maximize icon in the top right corner of its stack border. In this case, all the other parts are minimized and stored in tool bars.

**Minimize**
 Another way to optimize the use of the screen area is to directly minimize parts or stacks that are of no current interest. When minimized, the stack are reduced to trim bar, showing only the icons of the contained views on the outer border of the application.

Opening and closing views
-------------------------

Some views can be closed and reopened later. A closeable view has a close cross in its tab when activated.

**Close**
 Use the close cross in the view tab to close it
 
**Open**
 Use the *Window* > *View* menu to chose which view to open. If already opened, the target view will gain focus in its own view stack.
