Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Goko requires a Java Runtime Environment to be installed. It is available for download here : `Oracle <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html>`_


Both 32-bit and 64-bit Java Virtual Machine can be installed and used on the same computer.

To check your installed java version, take the following steps:
 #. Open a Windows Command Prompt
 #. Type ``java -version``
 #. A 32 bit version will output something like ::	 		
		
		java version "x.x.x_xxx"
		Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build x.x.x_xxx)
		Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build xx.xx, mixed mode, sharing)

 #. A 64 bit version will output the text below _(notice the 64-bit explicitely written)_ ::

	java version "x.x.x_xxx"
	Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build x.x.x_xxx)
	Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build xx.xx, mixed mode)
